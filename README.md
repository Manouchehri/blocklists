This repository is used for distributing various blocklists that I've written. You can either use GitHub directly, or the content mirrored to CloudFlare (`https://block.davidmanouchehri.com/[filename]`).

## File naming conventions

- Ending in `.url.txt` are meant to be used with [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
- Ending in `.host.txt` are meant to be added to your hosts file or used with [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

## Bugs

If you have any issues with a site after adding one of my lists, create a new issue on GitHub or send me an email (david@davidmanouchehri.com).
